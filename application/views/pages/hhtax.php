                <p class="overview">The only design parameters received for this proudly Texan-born business were the color scheme of 
                “red, white, and blue,” and the request for something simple and secure to IRS standards. Based on these terms, the 
                company values, and marketing materials from previous years, I worked closely with the owner to develop a brand image 
                for the business which informed the design of the site as well as their custom logo. The other aim of the site was to 
                ease the burden on my client as their business grew - to present information and secure means of uploading documents 
                in accessible and easily digestible formats for their customers in order to streamline their processes and ensure 
                clients were adequately prepared for appointments.</p>
