                <p>Now armed with a year's worth of experience with the brand and the team behind it, this second 
                redesign of the OutBranding Promos website was a complete departure stylistically from the redesign completed when I 
                was first brought onto the team. OutBranding Promos specializes in a concierge, individualized experience for every 
                customer, and so the design focus centered around the humans behind OutBranding. From both user experience and sales 
                perspectives, the key was to engender as many opportunities for connection  as possible between users and the team 
                members behind the brand.</p>

                <h2>Hasta la vista, vectors!</h2>
                <p>The previous OutBranding redesign focused on a vector-graphic style to create a cohesive design language throughout the site and speak to the fun 
                and creative aspects of the brand.</p>
                <p>In this redesign, we reframed the vector graphics as highlights rather than the central style in favor of product and team member photos to achieve 
                a more sleek and professional look that better answers the question, “What can customers expect when they select OutBranding Promos as their 
                promotional product service?”</p>
