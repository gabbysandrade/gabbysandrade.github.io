		<h2> About the Designer </h2>
		<p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my website! I am currently based in Austin but have spent my life moving around the globe.
		Hover over each flag on the interactive map below to learn more about the places I have lived and how those experiences have influenced
		my design perspectives. </p>

			<div class="infoText">
				<p> My home country of Brasil is vibrant, spirited, and multifaceted. When I think of my hometown, I taste my
				vovó's <em>bolo de rolo</em> and <em>surpresa de uva</em>; I see colorful marketplaces bustling with street vendors and patrons
				alike; I hear the lyricism of overlapping Portuguese as we share an after-dinner <em>café</em> and tell stories as a family;
				I smell fresh bread from the <em>padaria</em> around the corner and sea salt breezing in from the shore. The streets of
				Brasil have an undercurrent of unadulterated life that you can't help but be invigorated by. </p>
				<p> My personal design work leans toward bright colors, engaging shapes, and an overall sense of "joy." Much of
				that I credit to my roots in Brasil, where the pursuit of joy in all circumstances is a common mindset and leaks
				into all aspects of life, from food to clothing to relationships. </p>

			<h3> Hong Kong </h3>
			<img src="../images/hk_img3.jpg" class="infoImg" />
			<div class="infoText">
				<p> Hong Kong is a city like no other I have experienced since. When I lived there in the 1990s, it was a true
				melding of culture and minds, where people from all over the globe seemed to gather into one blended
				community. In my primary classrooms, my group of closest friends included girls hailing from
				England, France, India, Germany, and, of course, China. </p>
				<p> It is my childhood in Hong Kong that I credit with the global perspective I approach all design from - What are
				my influences? How can I honor them in my design? How will my designs be perceived differently by someone
				in Asia? Africa? How can I make my work accessible to someone outside of my community? </p>
				<p> As the ways in which we are all connected expand and become increasingly efficient and instantaneous, the
				importance of providing access to, understanding, and engaging with a global audience must not be
				overlooked. </p>

        <div class="mapInfo" id="puertoRico">
			<h3> Puerto Rico </h3>
			<img src="../images/pr_img1.jpeg" class="infoImg" />
			<div class="infoText">
				<p> Puerto Rico is a beautiful island, rich in culture and history. Old San Juan was a marvel to explore as a child,
				with its time-weathered battlements and clusters of colorful buildings. Puerto Rico, however, was also the first
				place where I ever truly experienced exclusion. </p>
				<p> Being Brazilian, my family and I spoke Portuguese, not Spanish. I was enrolled in a bilingual school, but half of
				my classes were still taught in Spanish, and for someone who had been previously schooled entirely in English,
				it was extremely challenging. We would attend school, and when we got home, our mother would reteach us
				the entire lesson again in English to try and help us keep up with our classmates. Many of my peers and
				teachers were kind, but there more than a few adults and children alike who would wonder aloud what I was
				doing there or complain they did not have the time to try to help me. </p>
				<p> Much like Hong Kong, Puerto Rico taught me the importance of accessibility. In the United States, it is often
				taken for granted that products, services, and websites will be available in English without any additional
				effort required. What does that accessibility look like for those who have different needs? How can they be
				shown they have a space in the products or services I am helping to produce or distribute? And, just as
				importantly, can these measures for accessibility be implemented in a way that conveys providing these
				different spaces is not a burden, but something we welcome? </p>

				<p> The islands of Hawai'i are what I consider "home." It is where I have lived the longest and where my parents
				currently reside. When I need to recharge or reset, the ocean has never failed to swallow my worries and
				strengthen me to emerge into the world anew. </p>
				<p> In Hawai'i, Hawaiian Studies is a crucial part of the curriculum and is interwoven throughout the subject areas.
				In most workplaces, Hawaiian cultural values and language are often part of mission statements and
				workplace expectations. Over the course of my time there, these values became central facets of my
				worldview and self-expectations, especially the values of <em>kuleana, mālama,</em> and <em>aloha.</em></p>

			<h3> Florida </h3>
			<img src="../images/fl_img1.jpg" class="infoImg" />
			<div class="infoText">
				<p> Miami is a bustling, colorful city where you either keep up or get left behind. It was jarring to experience a

				immersing myself in my ethnic identity and what “home” really meant to me. </p>
				<p> Despite this endeavor in soul-searching, the biggest impact Florida had on me was in music. My time in my
				high school marching band was transformative. Our band director was a creative genius, and he guided us in
				creating not just shows but experiences, blending music, movement, and visuals into an enrapturing
				encounter. His expectations for his performers were extremely high, and it was here that I learned the
				meanings of self-discipline, determination, and persistence. It is his standards I think of when I consider “the
				user experience” and the skills I gained from my time under his tutelage drive me to pursue a higher level of
				achievement with each design I create.</p>
